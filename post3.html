    <section class="scroll-fade">
      <p>In this post, I’ll explain the basics of computer networks, routers, IP addressing, and some of the CCNA-level knowledge I’ve recently started learning.</p>

      <h3>🌐 What is a Network?</h3>
      <p>A network is a group of connected devices (computers, printers, phones) that share data and resources. The internet is the largest network in the world!</p>

      <h3>🛠️ Routers and Switches</h3>
      <p>Routers connect different networks together (like your home network to the internet), while switches connect devices within the same network. Understanding how they work is key to network troubleshooting.</p>

      <h3>📡 IP Addressing</h3>
      <p>Each device on a network has a unique IP address. IPs can be dynamic (changeable) or static (fixed). They’re like addresses for your devices on the internet.</p>

      <h3>🎓 Starting My CCNA Journey</h3>
      <p>Recently, I started learning about CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate). It covers OSI model, routing protocols, VLANs, subnetting, and more. I’m excited to keep growing in this field!</p>

      <p>Stay tuned — I’ll go deeper into each of these topics soon. 🚀</p>
